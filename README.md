# Paper-Guide
Ideally, you want some A4 paper with proper grain. Most commercial papers have wrong grain, so moisture makes the book expand vertically instead of horizontally. And it ends up fighting the spine. 
Alternatively, you want some A3 paper and cut it to get proper grained A4 (not in half)

# Bad Paper

## Xerox Marathon - Α4 - 80 gr/m²
Too soft. Has some ghosting. Grain feels too stiff to properly bend it for an A5 book with wrong grain.
