# Paper-Guide
Ideally, you want some A4 paper with proper grain. Most commercial papers have wrong grain, so moisture makes the book expand vertically instead of horizontally. And it ends up fighting the spine. 

Alternatively, you want some A3 paper and cut it to get proper grained A4 (not in half)

# Decent

## Mondi Nautilus Classic - A4/A3 - 80 gr/m²
This is recycled paper, but so far it seems to hold nicely, and gives the book a nice grey background that is easier to the eye. Not sure how this is going to hold up in time.

## Mondi Color Copy 

## Fabriano multipaper

## Q-connect KF01092 - A4 - 80 gr/m² (A3 KF18002)
This is not a bad paper. Not archival. Not sure how the color will fade as the paper itself gets more yellow.



# Bad Paper

## Xerox Marathon - Α4 - 80 gr/m²
Too soft. Has some ghosting. Grain feels too stiff to properly bend it for an A5 book with wrong grain.
